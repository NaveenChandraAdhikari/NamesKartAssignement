# SocialMediaChecker

`SocialMediaChecker` is a simple Java command-line utility to check the activity status of a company's social media profiles based on their domain name. It currently supports LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.

## Features

- Checks if the LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram profiles for a company are active.
- Uses the domain name to infer the company name and checks social media profiles accordingly.
- Reports the status of each social media profile.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.

## How It Works

Given a domain name as input, `SocialMediaChecker`:

1. Extracts the company name from the domain (the portion before the first `.`).
2. Constructs URLs for LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram using the inferred company name.
3. Sends a GET request to each URL.
4. If the profile page is accessible (HTTP 200), it's marked as "Active".
5. If the profile page is not found (HTTP 404), it's marked as "Unable to determine".
6. For other HTTP response codes, the profile status is also marked as "Unable to determine".

## Usage

To use `SocialMediaChecker`, compile and run the program using the following commands:

### Compile the program

```sh
javac -d out src/org/example/SocialMediaChecker.java
java -cp out org.example.SocialMediaChecker <domain>
java -cp out org.example.SocialMediaChecker apple.com
Results for example.com:

https://www.facebook.com/example: Unable to determine
https://www.instagram.com/example: Active
```
